# Predicting protein folding using a replica exchange Monte Carlo method

Program for predicting protein folding using a Monte Carlo algorithm 

### Quick plan of project

Construct algorithm based on the article's method

Test the algorithm on the article's sequence examples to verify that it works

Try out new sequence examples (maybe using a notebook) ?
